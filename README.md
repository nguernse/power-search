# About

This is a tiny project that lets you customize a list of URLs to search for targeted information. Want to search for a subject on Wikipedia? What about a product on Amazon?

You can directly search on the site, rather than taking the extra step of searching it with Google.

This was a way for me to learn and play around with the following:

- Next.js's [pages directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) versus the [app directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts).
- [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) and [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/combobox) for UI components
- Working with [context providers and reducers](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context)

# Getting Started
